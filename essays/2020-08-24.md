Aloha, my name is Kylee Dean-Kobatake and I grew up on the island of Maui. I decided to major in MIS because I wanted to challenge myself and acquire a deeper understanding of technology. Growing up, I played a lot of online games and liked customizing my own microblogs as a way to convey my personality. 

When I entered college I initially intended on majoring in Travel Industry Management, but after doing a lot of thinking and reexamining where my interests laid, I decided to trust myself and switch my major to MIS. I look forward to taking ITM 352 and beginning my journey into the MIS pathway.
