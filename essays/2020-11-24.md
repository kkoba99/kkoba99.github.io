###### ^ Bad habit, I tend to go straight into coding without thinking or consulting other resources for help or guidance

### Introduction
Assignment 2 required us to add a login and registration page to our assignment 1 project, as well as consider how to use persistent and transient data in
terms of storing user data from the registration.[Here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html) is the link to the assignment.

### What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned that it is important to wisely name objects, because if they’re named the same thing then the page doesn’t process correctly.
That specifically caused a problem when I was trying to get the quantities string to go from the login to the invoice, since my form “login_form” was located in 
a div also called “login_form”, the quantities string wasn’t passing to the invoice correctly.

### Did you work with a partner?
I didn’t work with a partner, but I had some discussions with Justina about the assignment and we helped each other out for some parts.

### How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
If I needed help, I would go to Professor Port for an office hour. For example, I needed help because my quantity string wasn't being 
transported from the login page to the invoice and I had no clue why it wasn’t working, so I needed help figuring that out.

### How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
Ahh, developing assignment 2 was different compared to assignment 1 because we had to implement different functions, however I think 
that assignment 2 was a little easier than assignment 1 since it required a little less coding. Starting assignment 1 was more stressful because it 
was literally like, “What am I doing.. How do I start this…I’ve never done this before...” but starting assignment 2 was like “Ohh okay I know what I need to do, 
this is familiar”.

### Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I probably spent 20% thinking how to do something, 40% writing code, and 40% testing and debugging. Looking at this, I really need to do more thinking 
so that I can lessen the need of having to write more code or test/debug stuff. 

### Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
What worked well with this project was making the visuals of the login/registration page. I like how it looks and it matches the theme of the other pages. 
What didn’t work well was trying to figure out a way to show errors on the page next to the textbox that had the error (like a “Username is too short” message in red). 
There's a similar mechanism like this on my products display page, but I had a hard time trying to modify it for the login/registration page.

### If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could go back in time, I would have dedicated more time towards working on assignment 2. 
I feel as if I didn't spend a lot of time as I could have trying to make it better. Also, I would have used Google more if I had a problem or if I wanted to implement something
but didn't know how to.
