#### Introduction
For this week's WOD we had to create an invoice for items with javascript and some html. The invoice table had to have five items, their prices, quantities, extended prices, and the subtotal, tax, and total amount. [Here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html) is the link to the Invoice1 WOD.
#### Performance
To be honest, first looking at the WOD instructions I was a bit intimidated by all the words. I didn't really have a plan on how to begin it, so I just opened VS code and followed
the instructions to see how it would go. I was determined to finish the WOD with as little help as possible to see if I could figure it out on my own. Things were going smoothly until I forgot how to write the html table rows within the script, but I remembered we did something similar in Lab 6, exercise 6 so it really helped. It took some trial and error to figure out how to input the subtotal, tax, and total rows but I ended up putting them in separate scripts from the product rows. I also had trouble figuring out how to make the
subtotal, tax, and total rows fill the table while spanning two columns so I inspected the example table on the WOD to see how it was done. After practicing three times without a timer or recording, I did my first recorded attempt and barely made the RX time.
#### Preparation
To prepare for the WOD I opened VS code and followed along with what the instructions said. If I was unsure with how something were to be done, I would experiment with it until the output was satisfactory.  
#### Improvement
What I could've done to be better prepared was review the html tags for tables. I forgot how to write those, so going through the WOD took a bit longer because I had to look up how to write tags for the headers and rows. For the next WOD, I should also plan out what I should say while narrating because I still have trouble articulating what I'm doing while under the time pressure.
