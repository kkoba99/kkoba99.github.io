The WOD we had to do for this week was to create an invoicefor items with javascript and a little html. [Here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html) is the link to the Invoice1 WOD.

the instructions to see how it would go. I was determined to finish the WOD with as little help as possible to see if I could figure it out on my own. Things were going smoothly until I forgot how to write the html table rows within the script, but I remembered we did something similar in Lab 6, exercise 6 so it really helped. It took some trial and error to figure out how to input the subtotal, tax, and total rows but I ended up putting them in separate scripts from the product rows. I also had trouble figuring out how to make the
subtotal, tax, and total rows fill the table while spanning two columns so I inspected the example table on the WOD to see how it was done. After practicing without a timer or recording, I did my first attempt and barely made the RX time.
