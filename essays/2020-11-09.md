#### My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
	
 Prior to taking this class I had no knowledge whatsoever of coding, so I would say that my programming skills have improved immensely. It's pretty cool to become somewhat knowledgable about a subject that you previously had no idea about. More specifically, I am now able to understand the syntax of html, css, and javascript as well as figure out which code performs what functions. For example, I am able to recognize what a “for loop” is and write one if needed. I also know now what is considered “good practice” in terms of the format of the code, as well as to get into the habit of commenting.
  
#### I need to work on (and do) the following to improve my programming skills:
	 
   PRACTICE, PRACTICE, and MORE PRACTICE! I need to practice writing out code more. I often forget the exact way in which to write stuff like loops, functions, ect. 
   Also, I need to read more about their rules and how they work in detail so that I can be more flexible when using them. In addition, I sometimes forget what certain programming 	jargon means, so I need to review those as well. 
   
#### I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first:
	
  Ummm, it depends on the WOD. Generally speaking, I’m confident that I’m able to get far along in completing the WOD without referring to the screencast, 
  however there comes a point to where I need help understanding what to do for a step or two. More specifically, with the WODS that dealt with HTML/CSS I was able to complete them without refering to the screencasts, but for the later WODS I definitely had to refer to the screencasts because they were more complicated.
  
#### The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
	
  I agree, the labs are helpful in learning the material. It’s nice that they go step by step in explaining what to do. 
  The exercises allow us hands-on practice in putting together code to make a working product. I especially like the first question in the labs because they kind of ease you into the lab material without overwhelming you. 
  
#### I feel I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1):
	
  Uhh, yes and no. On one hand, assignment 1 was challenging so I feel that I need to keep working on it in order to fully comprehend how it works. On the other hand, 
  I feel like I'm ready to build more small web application like assignment 1 because it's more practice/hands-on learning.
  
#### I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
	
  I can’t really think about any other ways in which the class can be improved. The class is about a difficult subject, so I think it’ll just take some 
  time and practice on my part to improve my learning. 
  
#### These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:

  I really appreciate the recorded lectures. I would say they are the biggest help in my learning for this class because I can reference back to them when I need help or forget what we went over in class.
