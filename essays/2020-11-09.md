#### My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
	
  I am now able to understand which code performs what functions. For example, I am able to recognize what a “loop” is and write one if needed. 
  I know now what is considered “good practice” in terms of the format of the code, as well as to get into the habit of commenting.
  
#### I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
	 
   I need to practice writing out code more. I often forget the exact way in which to write stuff like loops, function, ect. 
   Also I need to read more about how they each work in detail so that I can apply them if needed more easily.
   
#### I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first:
	
  Ummm, it depends on the WOD. Generally speaking, I’m confident that I’m able to get far along in completing the WOD without referring to the screencast, 
  however there comes a point to where I need help understanding what to do for a step or two. 
  
#### The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
	
  I agree, the labs are helpful in learning the material. It’s nice that they go step by step in explaining what to do. 
  The exercises allow us to practice putting together the code to make a working product.
  
#### I feel I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1):
	
  Uhh, yes and no. On one hand, assignment 1 was a bit challenging so I feel that I need to keep working on it in order to fully comprehend how it works. On the other hand, 
  I feel like I'm ready to build more small web application like assignment 1 because it's more practice/hands on learning.
  
#### I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
	
  I can’t really think about any other ways in which the class can be improved. The class is about a difficult subject, so I think it’ll just take some 
  time and practice on my part to improve my learning. 
  
#### These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:

  I really appreciate the recorded lectures. I would say they are the biggest help in my learning for this class because I can reference back to them when I need help.
